        <h3>Pros vs Cons with the current designs and Why it is good vs bad?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        <h4>2013 MERCEDES BENZ C250</h4>
        <b>DASHBPARD:</b><br>
        <b>Pros:</b> The simplicity is clear and elegant, the fonts are bold and easy to read. It also has extra shields
        around each element of the dashboard which enhances the visibility.<br>
        <b>Cons:</b> Even though the fuel and temperature indicators are separated when the dashboard is looked at, the
        gauge lines for the fuel gauge continues which makes it a little confusing.
        The speedometer does not reflect in both miles/hr and km/hr .<br><br>

        <b>LCD DISPLAY:</b><br>
        <b>Pros:</b> It is functional and easy to use.<br>
        <b>Cons:</b> The design is rather basic and unimaginative.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h4>2017 HONDA ACCORD</h4>
        <b>DASHBOARD:</b><br>
        <b>Pros:</b> The fuel and Temperature indicators are clearly distinct and the speedometer is in both miles/hr
        and Km/hr unlike the Mercedes Benz E250. The design is also simple and clear<br>
        <b>Cons:</b> The font for the Km/hr is not very bold and clear.
        The fault indicators are also not very distinct on the dashboard.<br><br>

        <b>LCD DISPLAY:</b><br>
        <b>Pros:</b> It does have a lot of functionalities. There are so many things you can do on it including
        accessing real time information about the car.<br>
        <b>Cons:</b> There are 2 LCD displays which is redundant. One is for the entertainment system which includes
        the radio, Bluetooth etc. While the other gives real-time info about the car and how far it can go, shows
        compass, and it also gives an interface to get information about the car and the current journey such as
        fuel mileage, direction of travel, etc. One LCD should have been enough for those purposes.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h4>20O9 AUDI  A14:</h4>
        <b>DASHBOARD:</b><br>
        <b>Pros:</b> The fault indications are very prominent which is really important as that is a
        vital information to see when the dashboard is looked at.<br>
        It displays the number of miles before the car runs out of gas.<br>
        It also has buttons on the dashboard to modify some features<br>
        <b>Cons:</b> The fuel and temperature indicators should be more prominent on the dash board. It feels
        like they are hiding in the two corners of the dashboard.
        The gear status is also very small, it should be more visible. The design is not as simple and elegant
        compared to the Mercedes Benz C250.<br><br>

        <b>LCD DISPLAY:</b><br>
        <b>Pros:</b> It is functional and easy to use.<br>
        <b>Cons:</b> The functionalities are not very many compared to the Honda 2017. The look and feel is also
        not very modern as some functionalities donâ€™t work as well as they do on current LCDs<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h4>2016 CHEVY SUBURBAN:</h4>
        <b>DASHBOARD</b><br>
        <b>Pros:</b> This dashboard shows the state of the battery and the oil, in addition to the temperature and
        fuel gauge. All of these indicators are prominent and separated from each other and so there is no confusion<br>
        <b>Cons:</b> The speedometer should reflect in both miles/hr and Km/hr. the edges of the designs are to
        sharp. A little bit of roundness around the edges would make the design easy on the eye.<br><br>

        <b>LCD DISPLAY:</b><br>
        <b>Pros:</b> The LCD display is the clearest among the five cars. It has more functionalities at first glance
        and is easy to use.<br>
        <b>Cons:</b> Some icons are not easily understood at first glance.<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h4>Toyota Rav4 2018:</h4>
        <b>DASHBOARD:</b><br>
        <b>Pros:</b> The design of the dashboard is pretty clear and simple.<br>
        <b>Cons:</b> The fault alarms are not as prominent as the Chevy Suburban and the Audi 14, which is a
        very crucial purpose of a dashboard<br><br>

        <b>LCD DISPLAY:</b><br>
        <b>Pros:</b> The design of the dashboard is pretty clear and simple.<br>
        <b>Cons:</b> The functionalities are limited. And the GUI is basic and not easy on the eye.
